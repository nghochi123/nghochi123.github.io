# nghochi123.github.io

A portfolio website made with just HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

Made quite a while ago, just adding some stuff to it once in a while.

Probably going to improve it or transform it into a React-based static site in the future - Gatsby.js looks like it might be good for this.
